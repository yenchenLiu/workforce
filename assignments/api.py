    Assign tasks to workers using either Linear Programming (LP) or Greedy approach.
    Returns task assignments and KPI metrics.

    Parameters:
    - start_date: Start date for task assignment
    - end_date: End date for task assignment
    - method: Assignment method ('lp' or 'greedy'). Defaults to 'lp'.

    LP Strategy:
    - Formulates an LP problem to assign tasks to workers while respecting constraints
    - Constraints:
      - Workers can only be assigned tasks that match their position
      - Workers can have at most 8 hours of work per day
    - Objective:
      - Maximise total assigned hours (or minimise unassigned work)

    Greedy Strategy:
    - Groups tasks by date and position
    - Assigns each task to the worker with the least current workload
    - Balances workload distribution among workers

    KPIs returned:
    - utilization_rate: Total assigned hours / (workers Ã— 8 hours)
    - max_worker_load: Highest daily load across all workers
    - unassigned_hours: Total hours of tasks that couldn't be assigned
    - gini_coefficient: Measures workload distribution equality (0 = perfectly equal)
